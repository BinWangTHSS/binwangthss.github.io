Photon mapping is a popular framework for global illumination. A promising implementation of
photon mapping is the image space approach in which the scene geometry is encoded in a depth image. The image space
method has the advantage of simple implementation on GPU without the need of pre-computation of complex
acceleration structures, such as KD-trees, therefore allows fast photon-mapping computation. However, existing
image-space methods use only a single image for tracing caustic photons, so they are limited to computing only
part of global illumination effects for very simple scenes. In this paper we fully extend the image space approach
by using multiple environment maps for photon mapping computation to achieve interactive global illumination of
dynamic complex scenes. Two key problems due to the introduction of multiple images are 1) selecting the images
to ensure adequate scene coverage; and 2) reliably computing ray-geometry with multiple images. We present
effective solutions to these problems and show that, with multiple environment maps, the image-space photon
mapping approach can achieve interactive global illumination of dynamic complex scenes. The advantages of the
method are demonstrated by comparison with other existing interactive global illumination methods.			<br />
